	<div class="paragraph">
		<p> Your Name taps on an emotion that films nowadays don’t. It crafts an extremely beautiful story about longing and loss; and that’s not even bringing the artwork into account. Your Name features some of the greatest animation I have ever seen. The city is drawn as this hyper-realistic place, but when the story takes magical turns, the artwork does as well. The same could be said about the soundtrack; Your Name is not the same movie without the music. Your Name has always been my favorite movie since it is one of the movies that is really hard to hate.

	<div class="paragraph">
		<p> The Old Guard is a highly recommended movie for superhuman genre. It is about a team of immortal good-doers led by Andy, who has been doing these the longest. The Old Guard is a smart blend of action and emotion, plus it depicts how a female protagonist can lead a movie. Unlike the standard superhero team, the Old Guard themselves seem less like a collection of traits and more like real people. This gives the movie a more exciting vibe, which made me watch until the credits rolled over.

	<div class="paragraph">
		<p> Attack on Titan is not like any other anime. It does not appeal to what the viewers want to see in the series. Its overall nature always comes unexpected; it is a breath of fresh air in the Shonen genre. In addition to its impeccable storytelling, Attack on Titan offers some of the most vibrant, and interesting characters ever created. On top of that, Attack on Titan isn't afraid of sacrificing its characters either, irrespective of where they stand on that character hierarchy. This makes the show even more interesting to watch, and difficult to predict. All in all, Attack on Titan is one heck of a show. It's lived up to its expectations, and has continued to give us more than what we'd originally asked for.

	<div class="paragraph">
		<p> Prison Break is one of my favorite shows that kept me entertained no matter how many episodes I watch in a day. It is the type of series that I just never get tired of. Prison Break is a mixture of mystery, intelligence, legal & political views, and suspense. It is one of the shows that makes you want to know what their next move is. Lastly, Prison Break will always have a special place in my heart.
