	<h2> CHILDHOOD YEARS </h2>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Childhood is when you can smile from true happiness and appreciate the smallest of things. <sup>1</sup>
				Reminiscing the past really gives me the nostalgic vibes. <sup>2</sup>
				I remember the times that I spent with my childhood friends and classmates. <sup>3</sup>
				I used to enjoy playing outside with my friends during late afternoons; Tumbang Preso, Patintero, Luksong Baka, etc. were the games that made my childhood more memorable. <sup>4</sup>
				<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				At school, I was shy at quiet when I was at kindergarten, and I seldom interact with my classmates. <sup>5</sup>
				I feel nervous and uncomfortable probably because I was still adapting to my surroundings. <sup>6</sup>
				Soon enough, as a first grader, I began to socialize more and enjoy school. <sup>7</sup>
				I look forward to the lessons and events that will happen in school. <sup>8</sup>
				However, my grades are low and my mother decided to hire a tutor. <sup>9</sup>
				I remember how I always went to the nearby barrio for my scheduled tutor sessions. <sup>10</sup>
				Eventually, my scores got better and for the next academic year, I was shocked to find out that I was listed in the star section. <sup>11</sup>
				Since then, I was able to consistently maintain my grades and belonged to the star section up until my highschool graduation. <sup>12</sup>
				I can proudly say that our childhood is one of most precious memories we should treasure. Our experiences are cumulative which makes up who we are right now. <sup>13</sup>
				<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The past mistakes, failures, and challenges we've been through as a child, served as our guide in growing up. <sup>14</sup>
				I am glad and grateful to have experience playing with my friends outside before the technology era comes forth. <sup>15</sup>
				I've realized how priceless my childhood is. <sup>16</sup>
				We can never go back in time, so reminiscing my childhood sparks warmth in my heart. <sup>17</sup>
				Yes, I regret some things that I could have done as a child. <sup>18</sup>
				Doing things that makes you happy without a care in the world is just pure bliss. <sup>19</sup>
				I wish I could have spent more time with my friends, knowing that at some point, the time will come that we won't be together anymore. <sup>20</sup>
				Still, I can say that I am beyond blessed to have a such heartwarming and fulfilling childhood. <sup>21</sup>

	<h2> TEENAGE YEARS </h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				As I enter adolescence, the world I see slowly changes. <sup>1</sup>
				We are bound by our duties, roles, and responsibilities. <sup>2</sup>
				My teenage years mostly consists of my junior highschool and senior highschool days. <sup>3</sup>
				During this time, I witnessed the reality of the world we live in. <sup>4</sup>
				<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I learned how to deal with people, and respect their opinions. <sup>5</sup>
				I learned to value my family and helped with their problems. <sup>6</sup>
				I always try to be a good son as well as a good person overall. <sup>7</sup>
				My time in highschool really changed a lot in me. <sup>8</sup>
				I've become more sensitive in other people's feelings, and I learned to manage my priorities. <sup>9</sup>
				At this time, I am still undecided what I really want to become in the future. <sup>10</sup>
				When I was a child, I only thought of being a lawyer. <sup>11</sup>
				But, that's just what you call a little kid's dream, which is not to be taken seriously. <sup>12</sup>
				In reality, I don't really intend to become a lawyer. <sup>13</sup>
				By this time, I want to be a police officer. <sup>14</sup>
				Actually, I joined our school's ACP, which is similar to CAT in other schools. <sup>15</sup>
				I learned a lot about how the military works, and their training regimen as well. <sup>16</sup>
				We also went to Fernando Air Base in Lipa, Batangas for our encampment. <sup>17</sup>
				I had so much fun, and learned a lot of new things. <sup>18</sup>
				I get to assemble and disassemble an M16 rifle. <sup>19</sup>
				Plus, I experienced firing a rifle, which is loud and heavy. <sup>20</sup>
				I also gained new friends from different schools who also attended the encampment. <sup>21</sup>
				<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Honestly, my teenage years is the most fun for me. <sup>22</sup>
				This is the time of my life when I've experienced most of my firsts. <sup>23</sup>
				It is a rollercoaster ride of I am willing to take any day. <sup>24</sup>
				Adolescence is one hell of an experience. <sup>25</sup>

	<h2> COLLEGE YEARS </h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Adulthood is the time of your life where you need think of your future seriously. <sup>1</sup>
				Motivation is what keeps you to continue pursuing your dreams and aspirations in life. <sup>2</sup>
				Adulthood is the time when you need all the strength you accumulate to get by each day while still enjoying your life. <sup>3</sup>
				Priorities become more prominent, our perspective widens, and responsibilities become more heavier. <sup>4</sup>
				It's like entering a new dimension. <sup>5</sup>
				<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				College is takes your studies in a whole new level. <sup>6</sup>
				You are given the freedom to manage your own schedule, and no one would bother if you did not attend you class. <sup>7</sup>
				In college, I've learned how to be more responsible in how I handle my studies. <sup>8</sup>
				I became more concerned with my grades, and really tried my best to learn every subject. <sup>9</sup>
				Originally, I planned to enroll as an HRM student, because I believed that there are no jobs waiting for me after I graduate. <sup>10</sup>
				And so, I chose Information Technology as my course, since I like computers. <sup>11</sup>
				If there is one thing I regret, that is not following my heart in becoming a chef. <sup>12</sup>
				I think I'd be more motivated and fulfilled every day knowing that I chose what I wanted. <sup>13</sup>
				I believe I'll be more happy in taking classes, doing assignments, and going to school. <sup>14</sup>
				Anyway, studying Information Technology is also fun; I have the privelege to learn programming and how computers really work. <sup>15</sup>
				<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				If there is one thing I learned in college, it is the act of being kind and helpful. <sup>16</sup>
				College is not a competition; if you can help, even in a small way, then do it. <sup>17</sup>
				I am wholeheartedly thankful to all those people who helped me along the way. <sup>18</sup>
				The road will only get rougher from this point. <sup>19</sup>
				Hence, I will work harder to ensure that I will achieve my dreams in the future. <sup>20</sup>
				By the way, I want to become a businessman now. <sup>21</sup>
